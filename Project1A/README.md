# Project 1A - Terminal I/O and Inter-Process Communication
## INTRODUCTION:
In this project, you will build a multi-process telnet-like client and server. Part A of the project (this part) can be broken up into two major steps:

* Character-at-a-time, full duplex terminal I/O
* Polled I/O and passing input and output between two processes

You will be extending the same code in Project 1B, so make sure it is readable and easy to modify.
