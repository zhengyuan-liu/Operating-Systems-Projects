# Project 4C README

## Included Files:
* lab4c_tcp.c, lab4c_tls.c: two C source files for two embedded applications (lab4c_tcp and lab4c_tls) that build and run (with no errors or warnings) on a Beaglebone.
* Makefile: the Makefile to build and test the application. The higher level targets include:
	* default ... build both versions of the program (compiling with the -Wall and -Wextra options).

	* dist ... create the deliverable tarball.
