# Project 2ARaces and Synchronization
## INTRODUCTION:
In this project, you will engage (at a low level) with a range of synchronization problems. Part A of the project (this part!) deals with conflicting read-modify-write operations on single variables and complex data structures (an ordered linked list). It is broken up into multiple steps:

* Part 1 - updates to a shared variable:
	* Write a multithreaded application (using pthreads) that performs parallel updates to a shared variable.
	* Demonstrate the race condition in the provided add routine, and address it with different synchronization mechanisms.
	* Do performance instrumentation and measurement.
	* Analyze and explain the observed performance.
* Part 2 - updates to a shared complex data structure:
	* Implement the four routines described in SortedList.h: SortedList_insert, SortedList_delete, SortedList_lookup, SortedList_length.
	* Write a multi-threaded application, using pthread that performs, parallel updates to a sorted doubly linked list data structure (using methods from the above step).
	* Recognize and demonstrate the race conditions when performing linked list operations, and address them with different synchronization mechanisms.
	* Do performance instrumentation and measurement.
	* Analyze and explain the observed performance.
Viewed from a skills (rather than problem domain) perspective, this project focuses less on programming, and more on performance measurement and analysis.
